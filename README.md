# Problem description

The sales team has concerns about ongoing product sales in one of the stores. Specifically, they asked us to redo our previous sales prediction analysis, but this time including the ‘product type’ attribute in predictions to understand how specific product types perform against each other. This will help the sales team better understand how types of products might impact sales across the enterprise.

# Assignment objectives

•	Predicting sales of four different product types: PC, Laptops, Netbooks and Smartphones
•	Assessing the impact services reviews and customer reviews have on sales of different product types	
  o	 A chart that displays the impact of customer and service reviews have on sales volume

# Key Findings

•	Product category is not a relevant variable to predict sales volume. 
•	4 star review and positive service review are the best variables to predict sales volume.
•	New potential products have price conflict with the existing ones.
•	As the distribution of sales volume is not normal and the sample is small, the predictions in this report are limited in scope and should be taken just as a reference. In order to have a powerful decision making, it should be combine with a descriptive analysis and a better understanding of the market.
